SmugMug4r

== DESCRIPTION:
  
A wrapper around the 1.2.0 JSON API at SmugMug (http://smugmug.com).

== INSTALL:

Under the projects vendor/plugins directory, create a new directory called
SmugMug4r and copy all files/folders there.

== USAGE:

The first thing you need to do is establish a session. You begin by initializing
a new Session object using your API key. Then you use one of the login methods.

    # Establish a session
    session = Session.new("YOUR-API-KEY")
    session.login_anonymously
            - or -
    session.login("username", "password")

    # Don't forget to logout when you're done
    session.logout

Once you have a logged in session you can use it to get Albums, Categories,
Images, etc. from SmugMug. The methods closely follow the API's method names.
For instance, to return an array of Albums using anonymous login you would do
this:

    # Establish a session
    session = Session.new("YOUR-API-KEY")
    session.login_anonymously
    
    # Return an array of Albums
    albums = Albums.get(session, {:NickName => "nickname", :Heavy => 1})
    albums.each do |album|
       $stdout.print(album.title, "\n")
    end

Most of the method signatures require session and also allow an optional options
hash. In the example above you can see that we're passing the NickName and
Heavy optional parameters to the method. See the actual class documentation for
more examples.
